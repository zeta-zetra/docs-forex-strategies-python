Strategy Details
----------------

Here are the strategy details from ChatGPT:

.. note:: 

   - Apply two moving averages of different periods to the price chart.
   - Wait for the shorter-term moving average to approach and bounce off the longer-term moving average, indicating a potential range-bound market.
   - Use an oscillator, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Stochastic Oscillator, to identify overbought and oversold conditions within the range.
   - Enter a long trade when the price bounces off the moving averages and the oscillator is in oversold territory.
   - Enter a short trade when the price bounces off the moving averages and the oscillator is in overbought territory.
