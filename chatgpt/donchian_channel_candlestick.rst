Here are the strategy details from ChatGPT:

.. note:: 
    - Use Donchian Channels to identify a period of consolidation or range-bound price action.
    - Look for a morning star pattern (bullish) or an evening star pattern (bearish) at the upper or lower boundary of the Donchian Channels, respectively.
    - Enter a long trade if the morning star pattern forms at the lower boundary and the price breaks above the high of the pattern, or enter a short trade if the evening star pattern forms at the upper boundary and the price breaks below the low of the pattern.
